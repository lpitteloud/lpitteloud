# Hi there 👋, I'm Laurent !

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 

🚀 Here, you'll find a blend of **clean code**, **innovative ideas**, and a touch of **engineering finesse**. I'm a passionate **PHP/Symfony developer** with a strong belief in **methodologies that make a difference**. Let's dive in! 💻

## 💡 My Development Philosophy
I believe in writing code that's not just functional but also **elegant and maintainable**. My approach is driven by:

- **Clean Architecture**: Building software that stands the test of time.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Letting the domain guide the code, not the other way around.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Because confidence in code starts with a green test suite. ✅
- **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**: Bridging the gap between business and development with clarity.

## 🛠️ My Tech Toolbox
I'm fluent in the tools and languages that bring ideas to life:

- **Languages**: PHP, JavaScript
- **Frameworks**: Symfony, Laravel
- **APIs**: RESTful APIs, GraphQL
- **DevOps**: Docker, CI/CD pipelines
- **Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQlite, MongoDB
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Twig, Vite.js
- **Version Control**: Git (of course!)

## 🌱 What I'm Working On
Currently, I'm diving into the world of **SaaS development**, focusing on clean architecture and seamless integrations like:
- Creating highly scalable and user-friendly applications

## 🏃 Beyond the Code
When I'm not coding, you can find me:

- **Running marathons** (literally, training for a sub-4-hour marathon 🏅)
- **Playing and watching tennis** 🎾 (a sport I’ve been passionate about for years)
- Exploring the intersection of **technology and sustainability**
- Being a proud dad to two amazing kids 👨‍👧‍👦
